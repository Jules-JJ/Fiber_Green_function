# Green function of an optical nanofiber

The objective of this project is to calculate the analytical Green's dyadic function of an optical nanofiber (macroscopic object) in a vacuum.

## Program : Analytc_Green_fct_nanofiber.ipynb
Has the definition of the elements in the equation of the Green's fiber tensor from the paper "Repulsive Casimir-Polder potentials of low-lying excited states of a multilevel alkali-metal atol near an optical nanofiber", plus an example of the pole calculations.

## Program : Analytc_Green_fct_nanofiber2.ipynb
Has the definition of the elements that compose of the Green's tensor of the fiber and the definitions of the integrals over the contour at Erwan Stourm's thesis.
