# Green function of an optical nanofiber

The objective of this project is to calculate the analytical Green's dyadic function of an optical nanofiber (macroscopic object) in a vacuum.

## Program : Analytc_Green_fct_nanofiber.ipynb
Has the definition of the elements in the equation of the Green's fiber from the paper "Repulsive Casimir-Polder potentials of low-lying excited states of a multilevel alkali-metal atol near an optical nanofiber"
