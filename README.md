# Green function of an optical nanofiber

The objective of this project is to calculate the analytical Green's dyadic function of an optical nanofiber (macroscopic object) in a vacuum.

## Program : Analytc_Green_fct_nanofiber.ipynb
Has the definition of the elements in the equation of the Green's fiber tensor from the paper "Repulsive Casimir-Polder potentials of low-lying excited states of a multilevel alkali-metal atol near an optical nanofiber", plus an example of the pole calculations.

## Program : Analytc_Green_fct_nanofiber2.ipynb
Has the definition of the elements that compose of the Green's tensor of the fiber and the definitions of the integrals over the contour at Erwan Stourm's thesis.

## Program : Analytc_Green_fct_nanofiber3.ipynb
Has the definition of the elements that compose of the Green's tensor of the fiber and the definitions of the integrals over the parts of interest from the contour in Erwan Stourm's thesis.


## Program : Analytc_Green_fct_nanofiber4.ipynb
Has the definition of the elements that compose of the Green's tensor of the fiber and the definitions of the integrals over the parts of interest from the contour in Erwan Stourm's thesis. This program also includes an exaple of the residue contributions a selected guided mode, and those at "plus or minus beta0".

## Program : Analytc_Green_fct_nanofiber5.ipynb
This program has the full integration of the nanofiber's Green's tensor, this is done by performing the integral for a limited number of modes and performing a summation over the modes.

THis program also includes symmetry testing for the elements that conform the integrand g_nu.

## Program : Analytical_Green_fiber_ex.py
This program is an example of the behaviour of a dipole's spontaneous emission rate when moving further away from the nanofiber's axis.
